# BC Step Code City Tracker: Municipal Adoption Levels (2026)

British Columbia gives individual municipalities the authority to adopt energy and carbon requirements *above* the provincial baseline. The result is a fragmented regulatory landscape: a new-construction project in Vancouver faces entirely different mechanical compliance obligations than the same project in Kamloops — even though both are governed by the BC Building Code.

This tracker documents current Step Code adoption levels for key BC municipalities as of early 2026. **Always confirm the current requirements with your Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) before finalizing any design.** Requirements change frequently and without provincial announcement.

## The Two-Track Audit Framework

Before reading the table, understand that BC's building compliance system targets two separate — but related — outcomes:

**Track 1: Envelope Performance (BC Energy Step Code / BCESC)**
The BCESC measures how efficiently a building *holds* heat. The key metric is **TEDI — Thermal Energy Demand Intensity** (kWh/m²/year): a lower TEDI means the building envelope does more work, reducing the load on mechanical systems.

Steps 1–5 represent progressively tighter TEDI limits. Step 5 is "net-zero energy ready" — the envelope is so efficient that a modest mechanical system can handle the entire heating load.

**Track 2: Fuel Source (Zero Carbon Step Code / ZCSC)**
The ZCSC targets what *fuel* the mechanical system burns. The key metric is **GHGI — Greenhouse Gas Intensity** (kgCO₂e/m²/year): a lower GHGI means less carbon emitted per unit of floor area heated.

The four Emission Levels (EL-1 through EL-4) set progressively tighter GHGI caps:
- **EL-1**: Measure and report only. No cap. Gas equipment fully permitted.
- **EL-2**: Moderate GHGI cap. Gas heating permitted but must be limited.
- **EL-3**: Tight GHGI cap. Heat pump required as primary; minimal gas backup only.
- **EL-4**: Near-zero GHGI. No fossil fuel combustion for space heating. Heat pump mandatory.

**The third metric — MEUI (Mechanical Energy Use Intensity)** — bridges both tracks. MEUI measures the total energy consumed by all mechanical systems (heating, cooling, domestic hot water, ventilation) per square metre per year. A building with a great envelope (low TEDI) but an inefficient boiler (high MEUI) still fails BCESC. MEUI captures the efficiency of the equipment itself, not just the heat demand it serves.

  <p className="text-sm text-amber-800">
    TEDI tells you how big the heat pump needs to be. GHGI tells you what fuel it can use. MEUI tells you how efficiently it has to run. A project that optimizes all three — with a high-performance envelope, an all-electric heat pump, and a high-COP unit — clears every compliance threshold in every BC municipality, including EL-4.

## Municipal Adoption Tracker

*Last updated: February 2026. Requirements change without notice — verify with the applicable AHJ.*

| Municipality | BC Energy Step Code | ZCSC Emission Level | Gas Heating Permitted? | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **City of Vancouver** | Step 5 | EL-4 (Zero Carbon) | **No** | Zero Emissions Building Plan (ZEBP). Combustion prohibited for space heating and DHW in new builds. |
| **District of Saanich** | Step 3 | EL-4 (Zero Carbon) | **No** | Early EL-4 adopter on Vancouver Island. All-electric mechanical required. |
| **City of Victoria** | Step 3+ | EL-4 (Zero Carbon) | **No** | City of Victoria Climate Leadership Plan. Confirm current Step with AHJ. |
| **City of North Vancouver** | Step 3 | EL-3 | Limited | EL-3 allows heat-pump-primary with minimal gas backup if GHGI cap is met. Escalating — confirm current level. |
| **Burnaby** | Step 3 | EL-2 (Moderate) | Limited | Dual-fuel hybrid may comply at EL-2. Gas must be secondary and GHGI-modelled. |
| **Richmond** | Step 2 | EL-2 (Moderate) | Limited | Lower BCESC step than Burnaby, same EL-2 ZCSC cap. Gas backup typically viable. |
| **Surrey** | Step 3 | EL-1 (Measure Only) | **Yes** | BCESC Step 3 required. No GHGI cap enforced — gas heating fully permitted with reporting. |
| **Kelowna** | Step 3 | EL-2 (Moderate) | Limited | Interior municipality at EL-2. Heat-pump-primary systems strongly preferred. |
| **Kamloops** | Step 2 | EL-1 (Measure Only) | **Yes** | No GHGI cap. Gas heating fully permitted. Cold-climate HP specification still advisable. |
| **Prince George** | Step 1–2 | EL-1 (Measure Only) | **Yes** | Northern BC baseline. No GHGI constraint. Heat pump adoption driven by operating economics, not regulation. |
| **Penticton / Vernon** | Step 2 | EL-1 (Measure Only) | **Yes** | Interior Okanagan baseline. Voluntary adoption ahead of likely escalation. |
| **Nanaimo** | Step 2 | EL-1 (Measure Only) | **Yes** | Vancouver Island; has not adopted ZCSC above provincial baseline as of early 2026. |

## Reading the Table: What Each Column Actually Means

**BC Energy Step Code** — This drives your *envelope specification*. Step 3 requires better insulation and air sealing than Step 2. Step 5 requires near-Passive House envelope performance. The step required by your AHJ sets your TEDI target, which in turn determines how large your heat pump needs to be.

**ZCSC Emission Level** — This drives your *mechanical fuel choice*. EL-1 imposes no GHGI cap — a gas furnace is unrestricted. EL-4 caps GHGI at near-zero, prohibiting combustion for space heating. EL-2 and EL-3 fall in between, allowing gas only if a GHGI model demonstrates compliance.

**Gas Heating Permitted** — A practical summary of the mechanical implication. "Limited" means gas may be used as a minor peak-load backup if a GHGI model confirms the cap is not exceeded with the as-designed system. This is not a blanket permission — it requires engineering documentation.

## The Compliance Gap: Step Code vs. Retrofit Reality

A critical nuance: **Step Code requirements apply to new construction permits, not typically to retrofits of existing buildings.**

A homeowner in Vancouver retrofitting an oil furnace to a heat pump is not legally required to comply with ZCSC EL-4 — they are responding to operating economics, CleanBC rebates, and OHPA incentive structure.

However, the direction of travel is clear:
- New builds in EL-4 cities are already all-electric — no choice.
- Strata buildings in Metro Vancouver face the EPR deadline (Dec 31, 2026) which pushes collective electrical capacity planning regardless of retrofit mandate.
- As EL levels escalate across more municipalities, voluntary early adoption becomes increasingly financially rational — rebate programs are most generous while equipment costs are still declining.

The retrofit market and the new construction market are converging. Heat pump contractors who understand Step Code compliance — even for retrofit work — are positioning for the commercial and multi-family work that follows.

## How This Affects Heat Pump Sizing in Practice

The relationship between BCESC step and heat pump tonnage is not linear — it depends on your specific building. But the directional relationship is consistent:

| BCESC Step | TEDI Range | Peak Load at -5°C (1,500 sf example) | Heat Pump Sizing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Step 1 (baseline) | 60–80 kWh/m²/yr | ~25,000–30,000 BTU/hr | 2.5-ton system |
| Step 3 | 30–45 kWh/m²/yr | ~15,000–20,000 BTU/hr | 1.5-ton system |
| Step 5 (NZE-ready) | 10–20 kWh/m²/yr | ~6,000–10,000 BTU/hr | Single 9,000 BTU head |

A Step 5 build in Vancouver that requires only a 9,000 BTU unit has a lower capital cost for the heat pump than a Step 1 build requiring 30,000 BTU — partially offsetting the premium paid for the better envelope.

## MEUI: The Metric That Ties Both Tracks Together

MEUI (Mechanical Energy Use Intensity, kWh/m²/year) captures total mechanical system energy consumption. It is the bridge between TEDI and GHGI:

- **TEDI → MEUI**: A building with lower TEDI demands less heating energy from the mechanical system. This reduces MEUI directly.
- **MEUI → GHGI**: A building heating with a heat pump at COP 3.0 converts 1 kWh of electricity into 3 kWh of heat. A gas furnace at 80% efficiency converts 1 kWh of gas into 0.8 kWh of heat — and emits carbon. The same MEUI value results in a dramatically different GHGI depending on whether the fuel is electricity or gas.

This is why the BCESC and ZCSC are complementary, not duplicative: the BCESC minimizes how much energy you need; the ZCSC ensures that energy is clean.

For Step Code compliance modelling, your energy consultant will build a whole-building energy model (typically using EnergyPlus or HOT2000) that calculates TEDI, MEUI, and GHGI simultaneously against the applicable targets.
