# Heat Pumps in BC Condos and Strata Properties

Installing a heat pump in a BC strata property involves layers of approval, building-specific constraints, and regulatory considerations that don't apply to detached homes. The good news: it's increasingly common, CleanBC has pushed many stratas to adopt blanket approval policies, and the process is manageable if you know how it works.

This guide covers everything BC condo and strata owners need to know — from the Strata Property Act requirements to equipment options to how to get your application approved.

## The Core Issue: Common Property and Alterations

In BC, the **Strata Property Act** governs what owners can do with their units and what requires strata council approval. Heat pump installation typically involves two issues:

1. **Exterior unit placement** — The outdoor compressor unit is almost always on common property (a balcony, an exterior wall, a rooftop area). Under the Strata Property Act, altering common property requires strata council approval (section 71) or a 3/4 vote of owners for significant alterations.

2. **Penetrations through the building envelope** — Refrigerant lines must pass through exterior walls, which are typically common property. This requires approval and must be done properly (weatherproofed, fire-stopped where required).

**The practical result:** You need strata council approval before installing a heat pump. Many stratas have streamlined this process; others require a formal application.

## Does Your Strata Have a Blanket Approval Policy?

Since 2021, CleanBC has worked with BC's strata sector to encourage blanket heat pump approval policies. As of 2026, a growing number of BC stratas have adopted resolutions that pre-approve heat pump installations subject to certain conditions (licensed contractor, approved unit placement, noise limits, proper waterproofing).

**First step:** Ask your strata council or property manager: *"Does the strata have a blanket heat pump approval policy or a standard application form?"*

If yes, your process is much simpler — you fill out the form, confirm your installation meets the conditions, and proceed.

If no, you'll need to submit a formal alteration request under section 71 of the Strata Property Act.

## Types of Heat Pump Systems for Strata Properties

### 1. Ductless Mini-Split (Most Common)

**Best for:** Individual condo or townhome units

A standard ductless mini-split consists of an outdoor compressor unit and one or more indoor wall-mounted heads. This is the most common heat pump type in BC strata installations.

**Placement options:**
- **Balcony/patio:** The most common placement. Outdoor unit sits on balcony, refrigerant lines run through a small exterior penetration. Strata usually requires aesthetic guidelines (screening, placement rules).
- **Exterior wall bracket:** Unit mounted on exterior wall below or beside the unit. Requires strata approval and proper anchoring.
- **Ground level:** For townhome units with ground access. Easiest approval path.

**Considerations:**
- Noise: Modern mini-splits are quiet (40-50 dB at 1m). Specify the model's noise rating in your strata application.
- Refrigerant line routing: Lines typically run through a small (3-4cm) penetration in the exterior wall, then along the exterior to the outdoor unit. Penetrations must be properly sealed and fire-stopped.

### 2. Through-Wall Heat Pump (Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner / PTAC)

**Best for:** Older strata buildings where mini-split line routing is difficult; buildings with existing through-wall sleeves

Some older BC apartment buildings already have through-wall sleeves designed for PTAC units (common in buildings from the 1970s-90s). A through-wall heat pump is a self-contained unit that fits into this sleeve — no refrigerant lines outside, no balcony unit.

**Advantages:**
- Single unit, no exterior installation required
- Easier strata approval (minimal building impact)
- No outdoor unit on common property

**Disadvantages:**
- Less efficient than split-system heat pumps
- Limited capacity — suitable for individual rooms, not whole-unit heating
- Requires existing wall sleeve or creating a new large penetration

### 3. Building-Wide VRF/VRV Systems

**Best for:** Strata councils and developers replacing central heating; new strata developments

In multi-family buildings, a VRF (Variable Refrigerant Flow) system provides centralized heat pump heating and cooling to individual units. This is a whole-building solution, not something an individual owner installs.

If your building is considering a major HVAC upgrade, a VRF system (Mitsubishi City Multi, Daikin VRV) is worth evaluating. It requires a strata special levy or reserve fund expenditure but provides each unit with individual temperature control and modern heat pump efficiency.

This is increasingly being installed in BC strata buildings upgrading from older electric baseboard or central boiler systems.

## Strata Approval: How to Write a Successful Application

If your strata doesn't have a blanket approval policy, you'll need a formal application. Here's what to include:

**1. Describe the proposed installation in plain language**
- Type of system (ductless mini-split, specific brand/model)
- Outdoor unit placement (balcony corner, wall bracket, etc.)
- Indoor unit placement (which room, where on wall)
- Refrigerant line routing (describe path from outdoor to indoor unit)
- Contractor information (company name, license number)

**2. Address common strata concerns proactively**

*Noise:* Include the outdoor unit's sound rating in dB(A). Modern mini-splits (Mitsubishi, Daikin, Fujitsu) operate at 40-50 dB — quieter than a normal conversation. Compare to strata bylaws if noise limits are specified.

*Structural:* Confirm the outdoor unit weight and that mounting method is appropriate for the balcony/wall structure. For balconies, typical outdoor units weigh 30-70 kg — well within balcony load ratings.

*Waterproofing:* State that wall penetrations will be weatherproofed with appropriate sealant and that the contractor is experienced with strata installations.

*Aesthetics:* If the unit will be visible from common areas, describe how it will look. Some stratas require specific placement or screening.

*Reverting:* Confirm that if you sell or leave the unit, the installation can be removed and penetrations properly sealed.

**3. Include supporting documents**
- Manufacturer spec sheet for the outdoor unit (with dimensions, weight, noise rating)
- Contractor's strata installation experience or references
- Photos or diagrams showing proposed placement

**4. Request approval in writing**
Even if approved verbally, get written council approval before proceeding. This protects you.

## BC Legal Framework: Key Sections

**Strata Property Act, Section 71:** An owner must obtain strata council approval before altering a strata lot or common property. Council may impose reasonable conditions.

**Standard Bylaws, Section 6:** The default BC strata bylaws require written approval for alterations. Many stratas have customized bylaws — check your strata's specific bylaws.

**CleanBC Guidance:** CleanBC has published guidance encouraging stratas to approve heat pump installations and recommends that stratas with blanket refusals reconsider given provincial climate goals. This isn't legally binding but carries weight in dispute resolution.

**BC Human Rights Code:** Stratas cannot unreasonably deny accommodations for medical needs. If a heat pump is medically necessary (e.g., for a health condition requiring temperature regulation), document this in your application.

## What If Strata Refuses?

Strata councils can only refuse alteration requests on reasonable grounds. If you believe a refusal is unreasonable:

1. **Request written reasons** — Council must provide them if asked.
2. **Review your strata bylaws** — Confirm there's no blanket prohibition (these may be challengeable if they conflict with human rights or CleanBC guidance).
3. **Raise it at an AGM or SGM** — A 3/4 vote of owners can override council decisions on significant matters.
4. **Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT)** — BC's online tribunal handles strata disputes. Filing fee is $125. A strata that refuses a reasonable heat pump application without valid grounds may not prevail at the CRT.

In practice, most refusals involve concerns (noise, aesthetics, placement) that can be addressed by modifying the proposal rather than escalating.

## Rebates for Strata Owners

Individual strata owners can access the same CleanBC and federal rebates as detached homeowners, *provided*:

- The installation is for your individual unit (not common property)
- You have strata council approval
- The contractor is registered with CleanBC

**Available:**
- CleanBC Better Homes: up to $6,000
- Canada Greener Homes Loan: up to $40,000 interest-free

**What stratas as a whole can access:**
For building-wide VRF upgrades, strata corporations may be eligible for commercial programs. This requires a different application pathway — contact CleanBC directly for multi-unit building programs.

## Practical Tips from BC Strata Installations

**Book a pre-installation consultation with your contractor before going to council.** A good contractor will assess the building and confirm a feasible installation plan. Going to council with a concrete proposal (not a hypothetical) makes approval much easier.

**Reference other units in your building.** If any neighbour has already had a heat pump approved, that's precedent. Ask them about their process.

**Townhome strata vs. apartment strata.** Townhomes typically have ground-level access for the outdoor unit and fewer shared-wall concerns. Approval is usually simpler.

**New vs. older buildings.** Buildings constructed after ~2010 often have more accessible exterior wall construction. Older concrete buildings can make line routing more complex and expensive.

**Get a quote that includes strata documentation.** Some HVAC contractors experienced in strata work will include a strata application letter with their quote. Ask for this.
