# 100A Panel and Heat Pump Installation in BC: Load Calculation and Upgrade Roadmap

*Technical reference for BC homeowners and contractors — February 2026*

---

## The Core Problem

A 100-ampere electrical service was the standard for BC residential construction from the 1950s through the mid-1990s. Back then, most homes ran a gas furnace, a fridge, a range, and some lights. A 100A panel was plenty.

Modern all-electric homes are different. A heat pump, an EV charger, a hot water heater, a range, and a dryer running at the same time can push past 100A. Adding a heat pump without checking your panel first is how you end up with a tripped breaker at 6 AM on a cold January morning.

This guide walks you through the numbers before you call a contractor.

## The 80A Rule: Your Real Limit

**The bottom line:** A 100A panel only gives you about 80 amps of safe, continuous capacity — not 100. Heat pumps count as continuous loads. If your total running draw goes over 80A for more than a few hours, the main breaker trips.

<TechnicalDeepDive
  label="CSA C22.1"
  summary="A 100A panel's real continuous capacity is 80A — not 100A. This is a Canadian Electrical Code requirement, not a suggestion. Everything running in your home at once must fit within that 80A limit."
>

The Canadian Electrical Code (CSA C22.1) requires conductors and panels to be sized for **continuous loads at 80% of rated capacity**. A load is "continuous" if it operates for three hours or more — which describes a heat pump in heating season.

| Service | Rated Ampacity | Continuous Duty Limit (80%) |
|---|---|---|
| 100A | 100A | **80A** |
| 200A | 200A | 160A |
| 320A | 320A | 256A |
| 400A | 400A | 320A |

Everything in your house — heat pump, water heater, range, dryer, EV charger, lights — must fit within that 80A or the main breaker trips.

## What's Actually Running When You Need Heat

**The bottom line:** With a large backup heater in the system, a 100A panel is at its limit just running the heat pump on a cold night — before you touch anything else. Without large aux heat, the numbers work.

<TechnicalDeepDive
  label="Load Audit"
  summary="A heat pump with a 10 kW backup heater + hot water tank + lights = ~82A on a cold night. That's over the 80A limit. Add an EV charger and you're at 100A — the breaker will trip. The fix: choose a cold-climate inverter unit with no large backup strip, or upgrade your panel."

Use this table to estimate your simultaneous peak load. These are standard reference figures — confirm actual draw from your equipment's nameplate.

| Load | Typical Draw (240V) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Heat pump compressor (1.5–2 ton) | 12–20A | At outdoor design temp; aux heat not included |
| Air handler / blower | 3–8A | Depends on motor type |
| Aux / backup electric heat | 20–60A | If strip heat is installed — largest wildcard |
| Domestic hot water (tank element) | 20–25A | Element cycling, not continuous |
| Domestic hot water (heat pump) | 6–12A | Heat pump mode |
| Electric range (one burner) | 15–20A | Not typically simultaneous with peak heating |
| Clothes dryer | 20–30A | Not typically simultaneous with peak heating |
| Level 2 EV charger (32A circuit) | 30–32A | Continuous load |
| Lighting + misc small loads | 5–10A | Estimate |

### Scenario 1: 100A Panel, No EV Charger

| Load | Draw |
|---|---|
| Heat pump compressor | 15A |
| Air handler | 5A |
| Aux heat strip (10 kW, at design temp) | 42A |
| Hot water tank (cycling) | 12A |
| Lighting + misc | 8A |
| **Total** | **82A** |

**Result:** Over the 80A continuous limit. The main breaker may trip if any other load activates simultaneously.

### Scenario 2: 100A Panel, With Level 2 EV Charger

| Load | Draw |
|---|---|
| Heat pump compressor | 15A |
| Air handler | 5A |
| Aux heat strip | 42A |
| EV charger | 30A |
| Lighting + misc | 8A |
| **Total** | **100A** |

**Result:** At rated maximum before the first load cycle begins. Non-compliant under CSA C22.1 for simultaneous operation. Will trip the main breaker under real design conditions.

## The Aux Heat Problem

**The bottom line:** The part that overloads most 100A panels isn't the heat pump itself — it's the backup electric strip heater inside the system. Many contractors include a 10 kW strip heater by default. That heater alone uses 42 amps. Ask your contractor what size backup heat is in the quote before you sign anything.

<TechnicalDeepDive
  label="Aux Heat Sizing"
  summary="A 10 kW backup strip heater draws 42A on its own. Combined with the compressor (15A) and air handler (5A), you're already at 62A — leaving only 18A for the rest of the house. If a hot water element cycles on at the same time, the main trips. Smaller strip or none is often the right answer for 100A homes."
>

Most heat pump systems sold in BC include an electric resistance backup strip heater for use when outdoor temps drop below the heat pump's balance point, or for defrost boost. Strip heaters are sized in kilowatts:

| Strip Heater Size | Amperage (240V) |
|---|---|
| 5 kW | 21A |
| 10 kW | 42A |
| 15 kW | 63A |
| 20 kW | 83A |

A 10 kW backup strip drawing 42A, combined with compressor (15A) and air handler (5A), is already 62A — leaving only 18A for the rest of the house on a 100A service.

**In older 100A homes, the correct choice is often:**
- A cold-climate heat pump with a higher balance point (reducing how often aux heat activates)
- A smaller strip (5 kW / 21A) or no strip
- Combined with a panel upgrade plan if EV charging is also needed

## Heat Pump Options That Reduce Panel Stress

### Option 1: Cold-Climate ASHP with High Balance Point

Cold-climate rated heat pumps (Mitsubishi Hyper Heat, Daikin Fit, Bosch IDS) maintain full or near-full heating capacity down to -15°C or lower. In Metro Vancouver (design temp -5°C to -7°C), a cold-climate system may cover 100% of your heating load without activating aux heat for most of the season.

**Panel impact:** Eliminates or dramatically reduces aux heat draw. Compressor and air handler draw remain — typically 20–28A combined — which fits on a 100A service without other simultaneous high-draw loads.

### Option 2: Single-Zone Ductless (Lower Amperage)

A smaller single-zone ductless mini-split (9,000–18,000 BTU/h) draws 8–15A at peak. If you're supplementing existing baseboards rather than replacing a central system, a single-zone system is panel-friendly.

### Option 3: 200A Panel Upgrade First

Cost in Metro Vancouver: **$3,000–$6,000** for the homeowner side (panel, wiring, permit, inspection). BC Hydro or FortisBC service lateral upgrade (utility side): **$0–$2,500** depending on existing infrastructure.

A 200A upgrade gives you 160A of continuous capacity — enough for heat pump + EV charger + standard home loads in most BC configurations.

## Panel Upgrade Roadmap

If your audit shows a 100A panel cannot support your target configuration:

**Step 1 — Confirm your current service size**
Check the main breaker amperage in your panel. If unlabelled, have a licensed electrician verify. "100A" service may actually be 60A in pre-1970 homes.

**Step 2 — Obtain a load calculation from your electrician**
A proper load calculation per CSA C22.1 Section 8 accounts for demand factors (not all loads run simultaneously). This may show more capacity than the back-of-envelope audit above.

**Step 3 — Get BC Hydro or FortisBC service upgrade authorization**
Panel upgrades require utility coordination. The utility must authorize the larger service lateral. Lead times can be 4–12 weeks in Metro Vancouver — plan accordingly.

**Step 4 — Permit the panel upgrade**
Electrical work requires a permit from Technical Safety BC. Your licensed electrician files the permit and coordinates the inspection.

**Step 5 — Install heat pump after panel upgrade**
The panel upgrade should be completed and inspected first if the heat pump system includes large aux heat.

**Typical timeline: 6–10 weeks** from decision to energized heat pump, assuming no utility backlogs.

## EV Charger + Heat Pump Planning

Adding an EV charger to a 100A service is a separate decision from heat pump installation, but plan them together. A Level 2 EV charger draws 30–32A continuously — that's 37–40% of your 80A continuous limit before the heat pump runs at all.

**Recommended sequence for 100A homes wanting both:**
1. Upgrade to 200A service
2. Install Level 2 EV charger (40A circuit)
3. Install cold-climate heat pump (no or small aux heat)
4. Combined peak at design temp: ~60–75A — within the 160A continuous limit

This sequence qualifies for BC Hydro rebates on both and produces a compliant, future-proof system.

## What to Ask Your Contractor

Before accepting a heat pump quote:

1. **What is the aux/backup heat size in this system?** (kW and amperage)
2. **Have you reviewed my electrical panel?** (A legitimate contractor will look)
3. **Will this system comply with CSA C22.1 simultaneous load requirements on my current service?**
4. **If I'm near 100A capacity, what is your recommendation — panel upgrade or a different system configuration?**
5. **Can you coordinate the panel upgrade and heat pump installation permit together?**

If a contractor answers question 3 with "it should be fine" without showing you numbers, walk away.

## BC-Specific Context: Technical Safety BC Jurisdiction

In BC, electrical work — including panel upgrades — is regulated by **Technical Safety BC** under the Safety Standards Act. Work must be performed by a licensed electrical contractor and inspected by TSBC before re-energization.

If a contractor offers to "skip the permit" to save time, that is a compliance failure, not a favour.
