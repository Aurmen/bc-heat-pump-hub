# 100A Panel and Heat Pump Installation in BC: Load Calculation and Upgrade Roadmap

*Technical reference for BC homeowners and contractors — February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

**Most BC homes on a 100A service can support a modern heat pump.** The limiting factor is not the panel — it is the equipment choices made at the time of installation.

Three conditions make it work:

1. **Inverter (variable-speed) heat pump** — ramps up gradually, draws 8–25A depending on demand, no startup spike
2. **Correctly sized aux heat** — a 5 kW strip (21A) instead of the default 10 kW (42A), or no strip at all
3. **Energy Management System (EMS)** — watches real-time panel draw and defers non-critical loads automatically

A 100A service gives you 80A of safe, continuous capacity. A well-specified inverter system with EMS draws 28–54A at peak in BC conditions — comfortably inside that limit for most homes.

**A panel upgrade is still worth considering** if you plan to add a Level 2 EV charger at the same time, or are replacing a large central gas system with a ducted unit and large aux strip. But it is not a prerequisite for heat pump installation on a typical BC home.

## The 80A Rule

A 100A panel's real continuous capacity is **80 amps** — not 100. The Canadian Electrical Code (CSA C22.1) requires continuous loads to be sized at 80% of rated capacity. A heat pump running during heating season counts as a continuous load.

Everything running in your home at once must fit within that 80A, or the main breaker trips.

---

## Why Load Management Changes the Math

**Single-stage heat pumps** (older technology) draw full power or nothing — and their startup current spike is 3–5× their running draw. That is what overwhelmed 100A panels in older installations.

**Inverter heat pumps** modulate between 10–100% of capacity. In Metro Vancouver's mild climate (-5°C to -7°C design temperature), most inverter units run at 30–60% capacity for the bulk of the heating season — drawing well below their nameplate amperage.

**Energy Management Systems** (EMS) add a second layer. Current sensors at the main panel watch total draw in real time. If a dryer starts while the heat pump is running, the EMS signals the heat pump to slow down slightly. A well-insulated home holds temperature long enough that the occupant notices nothing.

Inverter modulation combined with EMS load management is why the math works on 100A.

<TechnicalDeepDive
  label="Load Calculations"
  summary="The CSA C22.1 80% rule limits a 100A panel to 80A continuous draw. With a 10 kW aux heater, a standard heat pump system hits 82A before accounting for everyday loads — over the limit. Switch to a 5 kW strip and add an EMS, and total draw drops to 54A. The math works when the right equipment is specified."

### CSA C22.1 Continuous Duty Limits

| Service | Rated Ampacity | Continuous Duty Limit (80%) |
|---|---|---|
| 100A | 100A | **80A** |
| 200A | 200A | 160A |
| 320A | 320A | 256A |
| 400A | 400A | 320A |

The Canadian Electrical Code defines a continuous load as one that operates for three or more consecutive hours. A heat pump in heating season qualifies. This 80% sizing rule is a code requirement — not a guideline.

### Reference Load Table

Use these values to estimate simultaneous peak draw. Confirm actual draw from your equipment's nameplate.

| Load | Typical Draw (240V) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Heat pump compressor (1.5–2 ton inverter) | 12–20A | At outdoor design temp |
| Air handler / blower | 3–8A | Depends on motor type |
| Aux / backup electric strip | 20–60A | **Largest wildcard — ask your contractor** |
| Domestic hot water (tank element) | 20–25A | Cycling, not continuous |
| Domestic hot water (heat pump) | 6–12A | Heat pump mode |
| Level 2 EV charger (32A circuit) | 30–32A | Continuous load |
| Clothes dryer | 20–30A | Not typically simultaneous with peak heating |
| Lighting + misc small loads | 5–10A | Estimate |

---

### Aux Heat Strip Sizing

Strip heaters are the largest variable in 100A panel calculations. Most contractors include a 10 kW strip by default — that decision alone often determines whether your panel works or doesn't.

| Strip Heater Size | Amperage (240V) |
|---|---|
| 5 kW | 21A |
| 10 kW | 42A |
| 15 kW | 63A |
| 20 kW | 83A |

A 10 kW strip (42A) combined with compressor (15A) and air handler (5A) is already 62A — leaving only 18A for the rest of the house.

---

### Simultaneous Load Scenarios

**Scenario A — 10 kW aux strip (over the limit):**

| Load | Draw |
|---|---|
| Heat pump compressor | 15A |
| Air handler | 5A |
| Aux heat strip (10 kW) | 42A |
| Hot water tank (element cycling) | 12A |
| Lighting + misc | 8A |
| **Total** | **82A** |

**Result:** Over the 80A continuous limit. Main breaker may trip if any additional load activates. Non-compliant under CSA C22.1.

**Scenario B — 5 kW strip + EMS-managed water heater (within limit):**

| Load | Draw |
|---|---|
| Heat pump compressor (inverter, ~60% capacity) | 12A |
| Air handler | 5A |
| Aux heat strip (5 kW, cycling) | 21A |
| Domestic hot water heat pump (EMS-managed) | 8A |
| Lighting + misc | 8A |
| **Total** | **54A** |

**Result:** 26A clear of the 80A limit. EMS can defer the water heater during peak draw, dropping total to 46A.

**Scenario C — 100A panel + Level 2 EV charger (non-compliant):**

| Load | Draw |
|---|---|
| Heat pump compressor | 15A |
| Air handler | 5A |
| Aux heat strip (10 kW) | 42A |
| EV charger | 30A |
| Lighting + misc | 8A |
| **Total** | **100A** |

**Result:** At rated maximum before the first load cycle begins. Will trip the main breaker under real design conditions. Panel upgrade required if adding an EV charger to this configuration.

## System Configurations That Work on 100A

### Cold-Climate Inverter ASHP (Preferred)

Cold-climate rated units (Mitsubishi Hyper Heat, Daikin Fit, Bosch IDS) maintain heating capacity at -15°C or lower. In Metro Vancouver (design temp -5°C to -7°C), these systems cover 100% of the heating load without activating aux heat for most of the season.

**Panel impact:** No aux heat draw. Compressor and air handler only — typically 20–28A combined.

### EMS with Smaller Aux Strip

If a backup strip is required for code compliance or comfort, specify a 5 kW strip instead of the default 10 kW. Paired with an EMS controller (DCC-9 / DCC-12 or equivalent), the system manages simultaneous loads automatically.

### Single-Zone Ductless (Lowest Panel Stress)

A 9,000–18,000 BTU/h ductless mini-split draws 8–15A at peak. If supplementing existing baseboards rather than replacing a central system, a single-zone unit is the most panel-friendly option available.

## When a Panel Upgrade Makes Sense

A 200A upgrade costs **$3,000–$6,000** on the homeowner side (panel, wiring, permit, inspection) plus **$0–$2,500** for the utility service lateral. It makes sense when:

- You are adding a Level 2 EV charger at the same time (adds 30–32A continuous — 37–40% of your 80A limit before the heat pump runs at all)
- You are replacing a large central gas system and require a 10 kW+ aux strip for design temperature coverage
- Your load audit shows less than 20A of available headroom even without a heat pump

**Upgrade timeline:** BC Hydro service upgrades in Surrey and Vancouver regularly run **8–16 weeks**. Start the utility application before finalizing your heat pump quote — not after.

## What to Ask Your Contractor

1. **What is the aux/backup heat size in this quote?** (Ask for kW and amperage — not just "standard")
2. **Have you reviewed my electrical panel?** (A legitimate contractor looks before quoting)
3. **Does this system include an EMS, or how do you plan to manage simultaneous load on a 100A service?**
4. **Will this installation comply with CSA C22.1 simultaneous load requirements on my current service?**
5. **Is the electrical work permitted under Technical Safety BC?** (Ask for the permit number at completion)

If the answer to question 4 is "it should be fine" without showing you numbers, get a second quote.

## BC-Specific: Technical Safety BC Jurisdiction

Electrical work in BC — including panel upgrades, EMS installation, and heat pump wiring — is regulated by **Technical Safety BC** under the Safety Standards Act. Work must be permitted, performed by a licensed electrical contractor, and inspected before re-energization.

If a contractor offers to skip the permit to save time, that is a compliance failure, not a favour.
