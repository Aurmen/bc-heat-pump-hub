# 100A Panel and Heat Pump Installation in BC: Load Calculation and Upgrade Roadmap

*Technical reference for BC homeowners and contractors — February 2026*

---

## The Core Problem

A 100-ampere electrical service was the standard for BC residential construction from the 1950s through the mid-1990s. At the time, the typical residential load was a gas furnace, an electric range, a refrigerator, and lighting. A 100A service was adequate.

Modern all-electric households look nothing like that load profile. A heat pump compressor, a Level 2 EV charger, a domestic hot water heat pump, an electric range, and a dryer can exceed 100A simultaneously. Adding a heat pump to an older home without auditing the existing service is how homeowners end up with tripping breakers at 6 AM in January.

This guide gives you the numbers to assess your situation before calling a contractor.

## What CSA C22.1 Says About Service Capacity

The Canadian Electrical Code (CSA C22.1) requires that conductors and panels be sized for **continuous loads at 80% of rated capacity**. A load is "continuous" if it operates for three hours or more — which describes a heat pump in heating season.

| Service | Rated Ampacity | Continuous Duty Limit (80%) |
|---|---|---|
| 100A | 100A | 80A |
| 200A | 200A | 160A |
| 320A | 320A | 256A |
| 400A | 400A | 320A |

A 100A residential service has **80A of continuous duty capacity**. Everything in your house — heat pump, water heater, range, dryer, EV charger, lights — must fit within that 80A or the main breaker trips.

## Typical Residential Load Audit

Use this table to estimate your simultaneous peak load. These are standard draw figures for common residential equipment — your actual equipment will have nameplate ratings that should be confirmed.

| Load | Typical Draw (240V) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Heat pump compressor (1.5–2 ton) | 12–20A | At outdoor design temp; aux heat not included |
| Air handler / blower | 3–8A | Depends on motor type |
| Aux / backup electric heat | 20–60A | If strip heat is installed — largest wildcard |
| Domestic hot water (tank element) | 20–25A | Element cycling, not continuous |
| Domestic hot water (heat pump) | 6–12A | Heat pump mode; element mode same as above |
| Electric range (one burner) | 15–20A | Not typically simultaneous with peak heating |
| Clothes dryer | 20–30A | Not typically simultaneous with peak heating |
| Level 2 EV charger (32A circuit) | 30–32A | Continuous load |
| Lighting + misc small loads | 5–10A | Estimate |

### Scenario 1: 100A Panel, No EV Charger

| Load | Draw |
|---|---|
| Heat pump compressor | 15A |
| Air handler | 5A |
| Aux heat strip (10 kW, activated at design temp) | 42A |
| Hot water tank (cycling) | 12A (averaged) |
| Lighting + misc | 8A |
| **Total** | **82A** |

**Result:** At heating design conditions with the aux heat energized, a 100A service is at or over its 80A continuous limit. The main breaker may trip, particularly if any other load activates simultaneously.

### Scenario 2: 100A Panel, With Level 2 EV Charger

| Load | Draw |
|---|---|
| Heat pump compressor | 15A |
| Air handler | 5A |
| Aux heat strip | 42A |
| EV charger | 30A |
| Lighting + misc | 8A |
| **Total** | **100A** |

**Result:** The service is at rated maximum before the first load cycle begins. This configuration is non-compliant under CSA C22.1 for simultaneous operation and will trip the main breaker under real design conditions.

## The Aux Heat Problem

The most common failure point is not the heat pump compressor — it's the auxiliary electric resistance backup heat.

Most ductless and ducted heat pump systems sold in BC include an electric resistance backup strip heater for heating at temperatures below the ASHP balance point, or as a defrost boost. These are sized in kilowatts:

| Strip Heater Size | Amperage (240V) |
|---|---|
| 5 kW | 21A |
| 10 kW | 42A |
| 15 kW | 63A |
| 20 kW | 83A |

A 10 kW backup strip drawing 42A, combined with compressor (15A) and air handler (5A), is already 62A — leaving only 18A for the rest of the house on a 100A service. If a water heater element cycles on simultaneously, the main trips.

**Verify before installation:** Ask your contractor explicitly what size aux heat is included in the system quote and whether it's appropriate for your panel capacity. In older 100A homes, the correct choice is often a cold-climate heat pump with a higher balance point (reducing aux activation frequency) and a smaller or no aux strip, combined with a panel upgrade plan.

## Heat Pump Options That Reduce Panel Stress

### Option 1: Cold-Climate ASHP with High Balance Point

Cold-climate rated heat pumps (Mitsubishi Hyper Heat, Daikin Fit, Bosch IDS) maintain full or near-full heating capacity down to -15°C or lower. The higher the balance point, the less frequently aux heat activates. In Metro Vancouver (design temp -5°C to -7°C), a cold-climate system may cover 100% of your heating load without aux heat activation most of the season.

**Panel impact:** Eliminates or dramatically reduces aux heat draw. Compressor and air handler draw remain — typically 20–28A combined — which is manageable on a 100A service without other simultaneous high-draw loads.

### Option 2: Single-Zone Ductless (Lower Amperage)

A smaller single-zone ductless mini-split (9,000–18,000 BTU/h) draws 8–15A at peak. If you're supplementing existing baseboards rather than replacing a central system, a single-zone system is panel-friendly.

### Option 3: 200A Panel Upgrade First

Cost in Metro Vancouver: **$3,000–$6,000** for panel and service upgrade (homeowner side). BC Hydro or FortisBC service lateral upgrade (utility side): **$0–$2,500** depending on existing infrastructure.

A 200A upgrade provides 160A of continuous capacity — sufficient for heat pump + EV charger + standard home loads in most BC configurations.

## Panel Upgrade Roadmap

If your audit shows a 100A panel cannot support your target configuration:

**Step 1 — Confirm your current service size**
Check the main breaker amperage in your panel. If unlabelled, have a licensed electrician verify. "100A" service may actually be 60A in pre-1970 homes.

**Step 2 — Obtain a load calculation from your electrician**
A proper load calculation per CSA C22.1 Section 8 accounts for demand factors (not all loads run simultaneously). This may show more capacity than the back-of-envelope audit above.

**Step 3 — Get BC Hydro or FortisBC service upgrade authorization**
Panel upgrades require utility coordination. The utility must authorize the larger service lateral. Lead times can be 4–12 weeks in Metro Vancouver — plan accordingly.

**Step 4 — Permit the panel upgrade**
Electrical work requires a permit from Technical Safety BC. Your licensed electrician files the permit and coordinates the inspection.

**Step 5 — Install heat pump after panel upgrade**
The heat pump installation permit and the panel permit can often be coordinated with one contractor, but the panel upgrade should be completed and inspected first if the heat pump system includes large aux heat.

**Typical timeline: 6–10 weeks** from decision to energized heat pump, assuming no utility backlogs.

## EV Charger + Heat Pump Planning

Adding an EV charger to a 100A service is independent of heat pump installation, but the two decisions should be planned together. BC Hydro's EV charger rebate requires a 40A or 50A dedicated circuit (32A or 40A continuous draw) — this represents 40–50% of a 100A service's continuous capacity before any other load.

**Recommended approach for 100A homes planning both:**
1. Upgrade to 200A service
2. Install Level 2 EV charger (40A circuit)
3. Install cold-climate heat pump (no or small aux heat)
4. Total combined peak: ~60–75A — within 160A continuous limit

This sequence qualifies for BC Hydro rebates on both the charger and the heat pump, and produces a compliant, future-proof electrical system.

## What to Ask Your Contractor

Before accepting a heat pump quote, ask:

1. **What is the aux/backup heat size in this system?** (kW and amperage)
2. **Have you reviewed my electrical panel?** (A legitimate contractor will look)
3. **Will this system comply with CSA C22.1 simultaneous load requirements on my current service?**
4. **If I'm near 100A capacity, what is your recommendation — panel upgrade or a different system configuration?**
5. **Can you coordinate the panel upgrade and heat pump installation permit together?**

A contractor who doesn't engage with these questions before quoting is not doing a proper load assessment. The right answer to question 3 is never "it should be fine" without showing you the numbers.

## BC-Specific Context: Technical Safety BC Jurisdiction

In BC, electrical work — including panel upgrades — is regulated by **Technical Safety BC** under the Safety Standards Act. Work must be performed by a licensed electrical contractor and inspected by TSBC before re-energization.

Unlicensed electrical work to support a heat pump installation voids equipment warranties, fails inspections, and creates liability for the homeowner. If a contractor offers to "skip the permit" to save time, that is a compliance failure, not a favour.
