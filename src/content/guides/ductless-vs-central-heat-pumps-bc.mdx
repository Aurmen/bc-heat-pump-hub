## How Each System Works

### Ductless Mini-Split Heat Pumps

**Components:**
- **Outdoor unit:** Compressor and heat exchanger (1 per system)
- **Indoor units:** Wall-mounted, floor-mounted, or ceiling cassettes (1-8 per outdoor unit)
- **Refrigerant lines:** Connect outdoor to indoor units (3-4 inch diameter)
- **Condensate drain:** Small drain line for each indoor unit

**Operation:**
- Outdoor unit pumps refrigerant to each indoor unit
- Indoor units blow conditioned air directly into rooms
- Each indoor unit controlled independently
- No ductwork required

### Central Ducted Heat Pumps

**Components:**
- **Outdoor unit:** Compressor and heat exchanger
- **Indoor air handler:** Located in basement, attic, or closet
- **Ductwork:** Network of supply and return ducts throughout home
- **Thermostat:** Central or zoned control

**Operation:**
- Outdoor unit conditions refrigerant
- Indoor air handler blows air through duct network
- Conditioned air delivered via supply vents
- Return air pulled back through return vents
- Single thermostat or 2-4 zones typical

| 1,800-2,500 sq ft | 3-4 ton | $12,000-$18,000 | $12,000-$18,000 |
| 2,500-3,500 sq ft | 4-5 ton | $15,000-$22,000 | $15,000-$22,000 |

**Home WITHOUT ductwork (must install):**

Same as above PLUS $8,000-$15,000 for ductwork installation = **$18,000-$37,000 total**

**After rebates:** -$6,000 to -$11,000

## Efficiency Comparison

### Ductless Mini-Splits: Higher Efficiency

**Reasons:**
1. **No duct losses:** Typical ductwork loses 10-30% of heated/cooled air
2. **Zone control:** Heat/cool only rooms in use
3. **Inverter technology:** Most mini-splits use variable-speed compressors
4. **No air leakage:** Refrigerant lines don't leak like ducts

**Typical efficiency:**
- SEER: 20-33 (cooling)
- HSPF: 10-14 (heating)
- COP at -15°C (5°F): 2.5-3.5 (cold-climate models)

**Annual energy use (2,000 sq ft, Coastal BC):**
~8,000-10,000 kWh = $960-$1,200/year

### Central Ducted: Lower Efficiency (But Improving)

**Efficiency losses:**
1. **Duct leakage:** 10-20% loss typical, up to 30% in old/poorly sealed ducts
2. **Duct insulation:** Ducts in unconditioned spaces (attic, crawlspace) lose heat
3. **Single-zone operation:** Less efficient than zone control

**Typical efficiency:**
- SEER: 14-20 (cooling)
- HSPF: 8.5-12 (heating)
- Effective COP: 10-30% lower than rated due to duct losses

**Annual energy use (2,000 sq ft, Coastal BC):**
~10,000-12,000 kWh = $1,200-$1,440/year

**Mitigation:**
- Seal and insulate ducts: Improve efficiency by 15-25%
- Zone dampers: Reduce waste by controlling airflow
- Regular maintenance: Clean ducts, replace filters

## Comfort & Performance

### Ductless Mini-Splits

**Advantages:**
- **Precise temperature control:** Each room independently controlled
- **No cold/hot spots:** Indoor unit placed directly in room
- **Quiet operation:** Indoor units typically 19-35 dB (whisper-quiet)
- **No air mixing:** Good for allergy sufferers (no shared duct system)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Uneven room temperatures:** Rooms without units rely on airflow from other rooms
- **Air circulation:** Less whole-house air movement than ducted systems
- **Direct airflow:** Some people dislike air blowing directly on them

**Best comfort in:**
- Open floor plans (air circulates naturally)
- Homes where rooms can be closed off (bedrooms at night)
- Mild climates (coastal BC)

### Central Ducted

**Advantages:**
- **Even temperature:** Air distributed throughout home
- **Whole-house circulation:** Better air mixing
- **Hidden equipment:** No visible indoor units
- **Air filtration:** Centralized filtration removes dust, allergens

**Disadvantages:**
- **Temperature variance:** 2-5°F difference between rooms common
- **Slower response:** Larger air volume takes longer to heat/cool
- **Duct noise:** Airflow through ducts can be audible (30-45 dB)

**Best comfort in:**
- Traditional layouts with many rooms
- Homes where aesthetics matter (no wall units)
- Areas with high dust/pollen (centralized filtration)

## Installation Differences

### Ductless Mini-Split Installation

**Typical timeline: 1-2 days**

**Process:**
1. Mount outdoor unit (ground or wall-mounted)
2. Drill 3-4 inch hole through wall for each indoor unit
3. Mount indoor units (wall, floor, or ceiling)
4. Run refrigerant lines from outdoor to each indoor unit
5. Run electrical to outdoor unit
6. Vacuum and charge refrigerant
7. Test system

**Minimal disruption:**
- No drywall removal (except small holes for lines)
- No attic/basement work
- No ductwork installation

**Challenges:**
- Line length limits (50-100 ft typical)
- Indoor unit placement (aesthetics vs performance)
- Condensate drain routing

### Central Ducted Installation

**Typical timeline: 2-5 days (if ductwork exists), 1-2 weeks (new ductwork)**

**Process (existing ductwork):**
1. Remove old furnace/air handler
2. Install new heat pump outdoor unit
3. Install new indoor air handler
4. Connect to existing ductwork
5. Modify ductwork if needed (balance airflow)
6. Run refrigerant lines
7. Test and commission

**Process (new ductwork):**
- Design duct layout (Manual D calculation)
- Install supply and return ductwork
- Seal and insulate ducts
- Install registers and grilles
- (Add 5-10 days, significant disruption)

**Significant disruption if installing ductwork:**
- Drywall cutting and patching
- Attic/basement/wall access
- Dropped ceilings or bulkheads

## Aesthetics

### Ductless Mini-Splits

**Visible components:**
- Wall-mounted indoor units (12-36 inches wide, 8-12 inches tall)
- Refrigerant line cover on exterior wall (3-4 inches wide)
- Condensate drain line

**Appearance:**
- Modern, sleek design (white, black, or silver)
- Cannot hide units (defeats purpose)
- Some homeowners dislike visible equipment

**Options for less visibility:**
- Ceiling cassettes (recessed, only grille visible)
- Floor-mounted units (less obtrusive than wall units)
- Concealed ducted mini-splits (hybrid approach, more expensive)

### Central Ducted

**Visible components:**
- Supply and return vent grilles (2-4 inches thick)
- Thermostat on wall

**Hidden components:**
- All equipment in basement, attic, or closet
- Ductwork hidden in walls, floors, ceilings

**Appearance:**
- Traditional, clean look
- Nothing visible except vents
- Preferred by homeowners prioritizing aesthetics

## Climate Suitability in BC

### Coastal BC (Vancouver, Victoria, Lower Mainland)

**Ductless mini-splits: Excellent**
- Mild winters allow high efficiency year-round
- Zone control reduces waste
- No ductwork needed in homes with baseboard heat

**Central ducted: Good**
- Works well if quality ductwork exists
- Less efficient due to duct losses
- Not cost-effective if installing new ductwork

**Recommendation:** Ductless unless you already have good ductwork

### Interior BC (Kelowna, Kamloops, Vernon)

**Ductless mini-splits: Good to Excellent**
- Cold-climate models perform well to -25°C (-13°F)
- Zone control maximizes efficiency
- Consider backup heat for extreme cold

**Central ducted: Good**
- Better whole-house coverage in colder climates
- Easier integration with backup furnace (hybrid systems)

**Recommendation:** Both work well. Ductless if no ductwork, ducted if good existing ductwork and you want whole-house coverage.

### Northern BC (Prince George, Fort St. John)

**Ductless mini-splits: Fair**
- Need cold-climate models rated to -30°C (-22°F)
- Backup heat essential
- Efficiency drops significantly below -20°C (-4°F)

**Central ducted: Fair to Good**
- Better integration with backup furnace
- Whole-house coverage important in extreme cold

**Recommendation:** Hybrid system (heat pump + gas furnace) preferred. Ducted heat pump integrates more easily with backup.

## Zone Control & Flexibility

### Ductless Mini-Splits: Superior Zoning

**Per-room control:**
- Each indoor unit has its own remote/thermostat
- Set bedroom to 18°C (64°F), living room to 21°C (70°F)
- Turn off unused rooms completely

**Energy savings:**
- 20-40% reduction vs whole-house heating
- Particularly effective in BC's mild climate (don't heat unused spaces)

**Flexibility:**
- Add zones later (run new line set to additional indoor unit)
- Easy to expand system

### Central Ducted: Limited Zoning

**Whole-house heating:**
- Single thermostat controls entire home
- All rooms heat to same temperature

**Zoned systems available:**
- 2-4 zones typical
- Zone dampers control airflow
- **Additional cost:** +$1,500-$4,000 for zoning

**Less flexible:**
- Adding zones requires ductwork modifications
- Not as granular as ductless (zone = multiple rooms typically)

## Best Applications

### Choose Ductless Mini-Splits If:

1. **No existing ductwork** (homes with baseboard, radiators, boilers)
2. **Want maximum efficiency** (no duct losses)
3. **Need zone control** (different temperatures in different rooms)
4. **Live in mild climate** (coastal BC)
5. **Want minimal installation disruption**
6. **Have open floor plan** (air circulates naturally)

### Choose Central Ducted If:

1. **Have existing good ductwork** (from gas furnace or central A/C)
2. **Prefer hidden equipment** (aesthetics important)
3. **Want whole-house air circulation**
4. **Need centralized air filtration** (allergies, air quality concerns)
5. **Have traditional layout** (many separate rooms)
6. **Installing new construction** (ductwork easier to install)

### Consider Hybrid Approach:

1. **Ductless for main living areas** + ducted for bedrooms
2. **Ducted mini-splits** (concealed units + short duct runs for each zone)
3. **Central ducted + mini-split supplements** (problem rooms, additions)

## Maintenance Requirements

### Ductless Mini-Splits

**Monthly:**
- Clean indoor unit filters (wash with water, 5 minutes per unit)

**Annually:**
- Professional service: $150-$300
- Coil cleaning (indoor and outdoor)
- Refrigerant level check
- Electrical connections

**Easier DIY maintenance:**
- Filters accessible (front panel opens)
- Visual inspection of outdoor unit

### Central Ducted

**Monthly:**
- Replace air handler filter ($5-$30)

**Annually:**
- Professional service: $200-$400
- Duct inspection and cleaning (every 3-5 years): $300-$800
- Seal duct leaks if needed

**More complex:**
- Filters may be hard to access
- Duct cleaning requires professional
- Harder to inspect for issues

## Long-Term Costs

**15-year ownership (2,000 sq ft home, Coastal BC):**

| Cost Category | Ductless Mini-Split | Central Ducted |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Initial install | $13,000 | $15,000 |
| Rebates | -$8,000 | -$8,000 |
| **Net install** | **$5,000** | **$7,000** |
| Energy (15 years) | $14,400 ($960/year) | $18,000 ($1,200/year) |
| Maintenance (15 years) | $3,000 ($200/year) | $4,500 ($300/year) |
| **Total 15-year cost** | **$22,400** | **$29,500** |

**Savings with ductless: $7,100 over 15 years**

## Common Misconceptions

### "Ductless can't heat a whole house"
**False.** Properly sized multi-zone ductless systems heat entire homes effectively. Open floor plans work best.

### "Central ducted is always better"
**False.** Central ducted wastes 10-30% energy through duct losses. Only better if you already have quality, sealed ductwork.

### "Ductless units are ugly"
**Subjective.** Modern units are sleek and unobtrusive. Ceiling cassettes are nearly invisible.

### "You can't add A/C to ductless later"
**False.** Mini-splits provide both heating AND cooling. Central heat pumps also provide both.

## Conclusion

For most BC homeowners without existing ductwork, **ductless mini-splits offer better efficiency, lower cost, and superior zone control**. They're ideal for coastal BC's mild climate and homes with electric baseboard or boiler heating.

**Central ducted heat pumps make sense** if you already have quality, well-sealed ductwork from a previous furnace or A/C system. Installing new ductwork adds $8,000-$15,000 and reduces efficiency, making ductless the better choice.

For Interior BC and colder climates, both work well—choose based on existing infrastructure and preference for zone control vs whole-house coverage.

Always consult HPCN-certified contractors for proper sizing and system selection based on your specific home.
