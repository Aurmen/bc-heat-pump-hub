# Heat Pump ROI Calculator — BC

A heat pump's financial case depends on three numbers: what you currently spend on heating, how much a heat pump reduces that cost, and how much the installation costs after rebates.

This calculator provides a rough-order-of-magnitude estimate. Use it as a starting point — not a contract.

## How the Savings Estimates Are Calculated

The calculator applies a fuel-type-specific savings rate to your current annual heating cost:

| Current System | Estimated Savings Rate | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Oil Furnace / Boiler | ~62% | Oil → heat pump is the highest-ROI conversion in BC |
| Propane Furnace / Boiler | ~60% | Propane costs 2–3× natural gas; heat pump savings are significant |
| Natural Gas Furnace / Boiler | ~35% | BC gas rates are low relative to electricity — savings are real but modest |
| Electric Baseboard | ~55% | Heat pumps produce 2–3× more heat per kWh than baseboards |
| Electric Forced Air | ~50% | Depends on existing system efficiency |

These rates are midpoint estimates. Actual savings depend on:

- **Equipment COP at your local design temperature** — a Mitsubishi Hyper Heat running at COP 2.8 saves more than a standard unit at COP 1.9
- **Your home's insulation level** — poorly insulated homes see lower savings because the heat pump runs longer
- **BC Hydro vs FortisBC electricity rates** — rates vary by utility and tariff
- **Whether you retain a backup system** — a dual-fuel hybrid uses less electricity but also less gas

  <p className="text-sm text-amber-800">
    The ROI on gas-to-heat-pump conversions is longer than oil or baseboard conversions because BC natural gas is relatively cheap. The financial case strengthens significantly if you add BC Hydro's time-of-use rates, carbon tax escalation, or FortisBC rate increases into the projection. The rebates, however, are still generous — and the payback period improves materially once CleanBC grants are factored in.

## Default Rebate Values

When you select a heating type, the calculator pre-fills an estimated rebate amount. These defaults are based on 2026 program maximums:

| Heating Source | Default Rebate Used |
|---|---|
| Oil / Propane | $16,000 (OHPA $10,000 + CleanBC $6,000) |
| Natural Gas | $8,000 (CleanBC $6,000 + BC Hydro $2,000) |
| Electric Baseboard | $8,000 (CleanBC $6,000 + BC Hydro $2,000) |
| Electric Forced Air | $6,000 (CleanBC only) |

You can edit the rebate field to match your actual eligibility. Use the [2026 BC Rebate Estimator](/guides/bc-heat-pump-rebate-calculator) to get a more detailed breakdown.

## Typical Installation Cost Ranges in BC (2026)

| System Type | Installed Cost Range |
|---|---|
| Single-zone ductless (1 head) | $4,500–$8,000 |
| Multi-zone ductless (2–3 heads) | $10,000–$18,000 |
| Central ducted (forced air replacement) | $10,000–$16,000 |
| Air-to-water (hydronic / radiant) | $15,000–$30,000 |
| Dual-fuel hybrid (heat pump + gas backup) | $12,000–$20,000 |

Prices vary significantly by region. Interior BC installs typically cost 10–15% more than Metro Vancouver due to logistics and cold-climate equipment premiums.
