# Oil Furnace to Heat Pump Conversion in BC: Complete Guide

Heating oil is expensive, volatile, and increasingly difficult to justify in BC. Homeowners paying $2,000-$4,000 per year to heat with oil are sitting on one of the most compelling heat pump conversion opportunities available — and federal and provincial programs specifically designed for oil-heated homes make the economics even more compelling.

This guide covers everything BC homeowners need to know about switching from oil heating to a heat pump: system options, costs, available grants, and how to navigate the conversion process.

## Why Oil-Heated BC Homes Are Prime Candidates

Oil heating is concentrated in specific BC communities — the Gulf Islands, rural Vancouver Island, parts of the Fraser Valley, and older rural properties throughout the province. These areas often lack natural gas infrastructure, leaving oil as the traditional alternative to electric baseboard.

**The oil heating problem in 2026:**
- Heating oil: ~$1.40-$1.80/litre (highly variable, up to $2.00+ in remote areas)
- Annual consumption for a 2,000 sq ft home: 1,500-2,500 litres
- **Annual heating cost: $2,100-$4,500**
- Oil prices are tied to global energy markets — unpredictable and trending up
- Oil tanks require maintenance and eventual replacement ($2,000-$6,000)
- Carbon tax on fossil fuels increases annually under federal policy

A heat pump running on BC Hydro electricity costs $800-$1,400/year for the same home. The annual savings are $1,200-$3,000+, with federal grants covering a significant portion of the switch.

## Federal Grant: Canada Oil to Heat Pump Affordability Program (OHPA)

This is the most important program for oil-heated BC homes and the one most homeowners don't know exists.

**Amount:** Up to $10,000

**Who qualifies:**
- Currently heating primarily with oil, propane, or wood
- Canadian homeowner (not renter)
- Income eligibility applies at enhanced amounts — low-to-moderate income households receive priority and higher grants
- Home must be the primary residence

**What it covers:**
- Air-source heat pump installation (full system cost)
- Removal of old oil heating equipment (in many cases)
- Can include heat pump water heater

**How to access:**
- Apply through Natural Resources Canada
- Work with a registered contractor
- Application must be approved before installation in most cases

**Stacking:** OHPA stacks with provincial CleanBC rebates. An eligible oil-heated BC home can access:
- OHPA: up to $10,000
- CleanBC Better Homes: up to $6,000
- BC Hydro additional rebate: up to $1,000
- **Combined: up to $17,000 in grants and rebates**

For many rural BC homeowners, this covers the majority of a full heat pump installation.

## System Options for Oil-Heated Homes

The right heat pump system depends on what your oil system currently does — forced air, radiant, or baseboards.

### Option 1: Replacing Oil Forced-Air Furnace

**Best for:** Homes with an oil furnace + ductwork

If your oil furnace distributes heat through ductwork, you have the ideal setup for a **ducted air-source heat pump**. The existing ductwork is reused.

**What's involved:**
- Remove oil furnace, oil tank (or decommission in place)
- Install air-source heat pump outdoor unit + indoor air handler
- Air handler connects to existing ductwork
- Electrical upgrade if required (typically 200A panel)

**Cost (before grants):** $12,000-$20,000 installed
**After grants ($10,000+ available):** $2,000-$10,000 net

Many contractors can complete this in 1-2 days. You'll have whole-home heating and cooling through your existing vents.

### Option 2: Replacing Oil Boiler with Air-to-Water Heat Pump

**Best for:** Homes with an oil boiler + hydronic radiant heat (in-floor, radiators, baseboard convectors)

This is the most technically complex but also the most comfortable outcome. An **air-to-water heat pump** replaces the oil boiler and continues heating water for your radiant system.

**What's involved:**
- Remove oil boiler and potentially oil tank
- Install air-to-water heat pump outdoor unit
- Connect to existing hydronic distribution (radiant floor, radiators)
- Buffer tank typically added for system stability
- Domestic hot water can be integrated

**Key consideration:** Existing radiant systems designed for oil boilers run at 60-80°C. Air-to-water heat pumps are most efficient at 35-55°C. Low-temperature systems (in-floor radiant) work seamlessly. High-temperature systems (older cast iron radiators) may need adjustment or supplemental electric element.

**Cost (before grants):** $18,000-$32,000 installed
**After grants:** $8,000-$22,000 net
**Best brands for BC:** Daikin Altherma, NIBE, Stiebel Eltron, Viessmann

### Option 3: Adding Mini-Split + Keeping Oil as Backup

**Best for:** Homeowners who want to reduce oil use but aren't ready for full replacement; homes in BC's coldest regions

A **ductless mini-split** handles 80-90% of heating hours, leaving the oil system for backup during extreme cold. This hybrid approach:

- Immediately cuts oil consumption by 70-85%
- Has lower upfront cost than full replacement
- Provides a fallback if the heat pump needs service
- Can be phased — full oil removal once comfortable

**Cost:** $8,000-$16,000 for multi-zone mini-split
**Annual oil savings:** 70-85% reduction in oil consumption

This is common in Prince George, Salmon Arm, and the northern Interior where sustained -25°C temperatures make full oil elimination more challenging.

## Oil Tank: What Happens to It?

The oil tank is a separate consideration. Options:

**Decommission in place:** The tank is drained, cleaned, filled with inert material, and abandoned. Typically $500-$1,500. Less disruptive but the tank remains on/in your property.

**Remove:** The tank is physically removed. Cost varies: $1,000-$3,000 for above-ground tanks; $3,000-$8,000+ for buried underground tanks, which may require soil testing.

**Underground tanks:** If your property has a buried oil tank (common in older Gulf Islands and rural homes), removal and remediation may be required before selling or refinancing. Budget for this separately. Some grant programs cover partial tank removal costs.

**Important:** Notify your home insurance provider when removing oil heating. Many insurers reduce premiums after oil system removal.

## Electrical Upgrades: What's Typically Needed

Most oil-heated rural BC homes have 100A or 200A electrical panels. Requirements:

- **Ducted heat pump:** Requires a dedicated 240V/40-60A circuit. Typically fits in a 200A panel without upgrade. 100A panels often require upgrade.
- **Air-to-water heat pump:** Requires 240V/30-50A. Usually fits in 200A panel.
- **Mini-split single zone:** 240V/20-30A circuit — typically fine in any modern panel.

**Electrical upgrade cost:** $2,000-$5,000 if required.

## The Conversion Process: Step by Step

**1. Assess your current system**
What type of oil system do you have — forced air furnace, boiler, or baseboard with oil boiler? This determines your conversion path.

**2. Apply for the OHPA grant first**
Federal grant applications often need to be submitted *before* installation. Don't book contractors until you've confirmed your OHPA application is in process.

**3. Get 2-3 quotes from registered contractors**
Contractors must be registered with both the federal OHPA program and CleanBC Better Homes. Confirm both registrations.

**4. Determine oil tank disposition**
Discuss with your contractor and get a separate quote from a tank remediation company if underground.

**5. Schedule installation**
Typical install: 1-3 days for forced-air conversion; 3-5 days for boiler-to-air-to-water conversion.

**6. Submit rebate applications**
CleanBC rebate within 90-180 days of installation. Contractor often handles this; confirm before signing contract.

**7. Notify insurer and reassess policy**
Once oil system is removed, contact your home insurer. Premiums often decrease.

## Finding a Qualified Contractor

Not every heat pump installer is experienced with oil-to-heat-pump conversions. For boiler replacements especially, look for contractors who:

- Have done air-to-water installations (not just ductless mini-splits)
- Are registered with the OHPA federal program
- Are registered with CleanBC Better Homes
- Can assess your existing hydronic system temperatures and advise on compatibility
- Provide references from similar oil conversion projects

Use our [BC installer directory](/directory) to find contractors in your area, then ask them specifically about oil conversion experience.
