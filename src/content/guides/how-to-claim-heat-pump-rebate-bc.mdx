## Programs Available to BC Homeowners in 2026

### 1. CleanBC Better Homes — Heat Pump Rebate
**Up to $6,000**

2. Contractor submits pre-installation registration (required for some utility programs)
3. Equipment is installed
4. Contractor or homeowner submits rebate application with invoice

### 2. Canada Greener Homes Loan
**Up to $40,000 interest-free**

The federal Canada Greener Homes Grant was discontinued in 2024, but the **loan program remains active**. This is a 0% interest loan — not a grant — repaid over up to 10 years.

**What it covers:**
- Heat pump installation (any qualifying type)
- Paired with insulation, windows, or other energy upgrades

**Who qualifies:**
- Canadian homeowner
- Home built before 2021
- Must have an EnerGuide home evaluation completed

**How to apply:**
1. Register at [canada.ca/en/natural-resources/services/homes/canada-greener-homes-initiative](https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources/services/homes/canada-greener-homes-initiative)
2. Book a pre-retrofit EnerGuide evaluation (~$400-600; eligible for reimbursement up to $600)
3. Complete eligible retrofits (including heat pump)
4. Book post-retrofit EnerGuide evaluation
5. Submit invoices and receive loan funding

**Timeline:** Allow 3-6 months for the full process. Start registration early.

### 3. Canada Oil to Heat Pump Affordability Program (OHPA)
**Up to $10,000**

Specifically for BC homeowners currently heating with **oil, propane, or wood** who are switching to a heat pump. This is one of the most generous programs available and significantly underutilized.

**Who qualifies:**
- Currently heating primarily with heating oil, propane, or wood
- Household income under $120,000 (some provinces; verify federal eligibility)
- Low- and moderate-income households may qualify for higher amounts

**What it covers:**
- Full heat pump system installation
- Removal of old oil/propane equipment (in some cases)

**How to apply:**
- Apply through Natural Resources Canada
- Contractor must be registered with the program
- Installation must be completed after approval

**Note:** This stacks with provincial CleanBC rebates. An oil-heated BC home switching to heat pump can access $10,000 (federal) + up to $6,000 (provincial) = **$16,000 combined**.

### 4. BC Hydro and FortisBC Rebates
**Additional $500-$2,000 depending on utility and equipment**

Your utility provider may offer additional rebates beyond the CleanBC provincial program.

**BC Hydro:** Additional rebates for qualifying heat pumps; check [bchydro.com/powersmart](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart)

**FortisBC:** If you're a FortisBC gas customer switching to heat pump, additional transition incentives may apply; check [fortisbc.com/rebates](https://www.fortisbc.com/rebates)

These typically stack with CleanBC rebates. Your registered contractor should know the current amounts.

## Step-by-Step: The Right Order to Apply

Getting the order wrong is the most common mistake. Some programs require pre-approval; others only accept post-installation claims.

**Step 1: Check eligibility first**
Visit [betterhomesbc.ca](https://www.betterhomesbc.ca) and the Canada Greener Homes portal to confirm your home and circumstances qualify before spending anything.

**Step 2: Register for Canada Greener Homes Loan (if using it)**
Book your EnerGuide pre-assessment first. This must happen *before* installation to qualify for federal funding.

**Step 3: Get quotes from registered contractors**
Contractors must be registered with CleanBC to submit rebate applications on your behalf. Ask explicitly: *"Are you registered with CleanBC Better Homes?"* Get 2-3 quotes.

**Step 4: Confirm utility pre-registration (if required)**
If your utility (BC Hydro, FortisBC) requires pre-registration, your contractor handles this before installation begins.

**Step 5: Install the equipment**
Your contractor completes the installation and provides a detailed invoice showing model number, HSPF2 rating, and installation address.

**Step 6: Submit rebate applications**
- CleanBC/utility rebate: contractor typically submits on your behalf, or you submit with contractor's supporting documentation
- Federal loan: submit post-installation through Greener Homes portal with invoices

**Step 7: Book post-retrofit EnerGuide assessment (if using federal loan)**
Required to close out the federal loan application.

## Equipment Eligibility — What Qualifies

Not every heat pump qualifies. Programs require specific minimum efficiency ratings.

**Minimum thresholds (2026 — verify as these change):**
- HSPF2 ≥ 7.1 for most ductless mini-split rebates
- Cold-climate models (HSPF2 ≥ 7.5 or rated to -15°C) qualify for enhanced tiers
- Air-to-water heat pumps: separate eligibility criteria

**Verify the specific model** appears on the current CleanBC eligible products list before purchasing. Your contractor should confirm this — if they can't, ask them to look it up.

## Common Mistakes That Cost Homeowners Money

**Installing before registering for the federal loan.**
The Greener Homes Loan requires a pre-assessment before installation. Installing first disqualifies you from the loan.

**Using an unregistered contractor.**
If your contractor isn't registered with CleanBC Better Homes, you cannot claim the provincial rebate. Always verify registration before signing anything.

**Buying equipment that doesn't meet HSPF2 thresholds.**
The cheapest heat pump on the market may not qualify. Confirm the model is on the eligible list.

**Missing the application deadline.**
Most rebate programs have submission deadlines after installation (often 90-180 days). Don't wait.

**Not stacking programs.**
Many homeowners only claim one rebate when they qualify for multiple. Run through every program above with your contractor.
