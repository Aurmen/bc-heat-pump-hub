# Can I Install a Heat Pump on a 100 Amp Panel? (Surrey & Vancouver Guide)

*Technical reference for Lower Mainland homeowners — February 2026*

---

## The Problem Is Specific to This Region

Metro Vancouver and Surrey have a lot of homes built between 1955 and 1990 with 100-amp electrical panels. These are detached houses with gas furnaces, one car, no EV charger. They were never built for an all-electric heating system.

When a homeowner in this situation calls for a heat pump quote, the honest answer is: **you have a panel decision to make before you have a heat pump decision to make.**

There are two paths. One costs more upfront. The other requires smarter equipment choices. Both work.

## Path 1: BC Hydro Service Upgrade

A 100A to 200A upgrade in Metro Vancouver costs **$3,000–$6,000** on the homeowner side. BC Hydro's side of the work — upgrading the service line from the street — costs you **$0 to approximately $2,500** depending on what's already at your meter.

**The real cost is time, not always money.** BC Hydro service upgrade wait times in Surrey and Vancouver regularly run **8–16 weeks** because of scheduling and utility coordination. If you want a heat pump before next winter, start the utility application now.

**Steps for a BC Hydro service upgrade:**

1. Have a licensed electrician confirm the scope and pull a permit from Technical Safety BC
2. Submit a BC Hydro Service Extension Application online to request the utility-side upgrade
3. Schedule homeowner-side panel work (can sometimes run in parallel)
4. BC Hydro installs new service lateral; inspection is coordinated
5. Heat pump installation proceeds on new 200A service

A 200A service gives you 160A of safe, continuous capacity — enough for heat pump, EV charger, and standard home loads.

## Path 2: Energy Management System (EMS) on an Existing 100A Service

If upgrading your panel isn't possible right now — cost, rental property, strata restrictions — an **Energy Management System** lets a heat pump share your limited 100A capacity with other big appliances by making sure they don't all run at the same time.

### How EMS Works

An EMS watches the real-time current draw at your main panel. When the total draw gets close to the service limit, it tells the heat pump to slow down a bit. The house stays warm because the building holds heat for a short time. You don't notice.

This is not the same as turning your heat pump off and on. Modern inverter heat pumps can run at different speeds. An EMS that talks to an inverter unit turns the speed down, not the system off — which is better for the compressor and better for your comfort.

### DCC-9 / DCC-12 Load Controllers

The **DCC-9 and DCC-12** are examples of dynamic current controllers used for exactly this purpose. They watch your panel amperage and send a slow-down signal to the heat pump when other big loads activate. Your dryer keeps drying. Your heat pump keeps heating. Your breaker doesn't trip.

**Installation:** EMS hardware needs a licensed electrician to install current sensors. The heat pump must be compatible — most modern inverter units support external demand signals. Confirm compatibility with your contractor before purchasing.

## Why Inverter Units Are Essential for 100A Installations

This is not a sales pitch. It's a technical requirement.

**Old single-stage heat pump (on/off):**
- Compressor either runs at full power or is completely off
- Start-up current spike: 3–5× normal running current for 1–2 seconds
- A 2-ton unit may pull 40–50A at startup — enough to trip a loaded 100A panel
- Cannot slow down in response to an EMS signal

**Modern inverter (variable-speed) heat pump:**
- Compressor runs anywhere from 10% to 100% of capacity
- Soft-start: ramps up gradually over several seconds — no startup spike
- Normal draw: 8–12A when it's not very cold, up to 18–25A on the coldest days
- Slows down (doesn't turn off) in response to an EMS signal
- In Metro Vancouver's mild climate, often runs at 30–60% capacity — well below nameplate draw

**The key point:** The nameplate amperage on the unit is its maximum. In Metro Vancouver weather, an inverter heat pump usually draws far less than its maximum. A well-selected inverter unit on a 100A panel, managed by an EMS, can work.

## What the Numbers Actually Look Like

**The bottom line:** A Surrey home with an inverter heat pump + hot water heat pump + EV charger managed by a smart EMS controller peaks at around 36 amps on the coldest nights — well within the 80A safe limit of a 100A panel. The math works when you use the right equipment.

<TechnicalDeepDive
  label="Load Calculation"
  summary="A Surrey home (1978, 100A service) with an inverter mini-split, heat pump water heater, and EMS-managed EV charger draws about 28A on a mild heating day and 36A at design temperature (-6°C). Both are safely within the 80A continuous limit of a 100A service — no panel upgrade needed if equipment is chosen correctly."

Surrey home, built 1978: 100A service, gas furnace being replaced, one EV (Level 2 charger requested).

**Mild heating day:**

| Load | Running Draw |
|---|---|
| 1.5-ton inverter mini-split (mild day, ~40% capacity) | 12A |
| Domestic hot water heat pump | 8A |
| Lighting + refrigerator + misc | 8A |
| EV charger (Level 2, managed by EMS) | 0A (deferred while HP running) |
| **Total (EMS-managed)** | **28A** |

**Design temperature night (-6°C):**

| Load | Running Draw |
|---|---|
| 1.5-ton inverter mini-split (heating, design temp, ~80% capacity) | 20A |
| Domestic hot water heat pump | 8A |
| Lighting + misc | 8A |
| EV charger (EMS-deferred during HP peak) | 0A |
| **Total** | **36A** |

Both scenarios are well within the 80A continuous duty limit of a 100A service.

**How EV charging still happens:** The EMS defers EV charging to overnight off-peak windows when the heat pump runs at low capacity. Full EV charging rate resumes when other major loads drop. The car charges fully overnight — the panel just manages the sequence.

**What makes this work:**
- Inverter heat pump (not single-stage)
- EMS with current sensors at the main panel
- No large aux heat strip (or a small 5 kW strip only)
- Licensed electrician who understands simultaneous load management

## Rebate Interaction: Does a Panel Upgrade Qualify?

There is no standalone rebate for a panel upgrade in BC as of 2026. However:

- **Canada Greener Homes Loan** (up to $40,000, 0% interest) can cover the panel upgrade *and* the heat pump as part of one eligible retrofit application
- **CleanBC Better Homes** rebate applies to the heat pump equipment — not the panel, but requires a permitted, inspected installation (which means compliant electrical)
- **BC Hydro** doesn't rebate panel upgrades directly

If you're doing both a panel upgrade and a heat pump, apply for the Greener Homes Loan first — it can cover both under a single application.

## Contractor Verification: What to Confirm

Before accepting any quote for a heat pump on a 100A service:

- [ ] Contractor has reviewed your panel and confirmed available capacity
- [ ] System specified is an **inverter-driven** unit (not single-stage)
- [ ] Aux heat strip size (if included) is sized appropriately for your service capacity
- [ ] If EMS is proposed: confirm heat pump model supports external demand signal
- [ ] Electrical work is permitted under Technical Safety BC — ask for the permit number
- [ ] Contractor is CleanBC Better Homes registered (required for rebate)

Verify contractor license: [Technical Safety BC](https://www.technicalsafetybc.ca/licence-search)
Verify CleanBC registration: [CleanBC Better Homes](https://betterhomesbc.ca/find-a-contractor/)
