## Phase 1: Pre-Installation (1-4 Weeks)

### Step 1: Initial Consultation & Site Assessment

**What happens:**
- Contractor visits your home
- Measures rooms, checks insulation, inspects electrical panel
- Discusses your heating needs, budget, preferences
- Identifies installation challenges (long line runs, electrical upgrades needed, etc.)

**What to ask:**
- "What size system do you recommend and why?"
- "Will you perform a Manual J load calculation?"
- "Do I need electrical upgrades?"
- "What's included in your quote?"

**Red flags:**
- Sizing by square footage alone (without load calculation)
- Quotes without site visit
- Pressure to sign immediately

---

### Step 2: Load Calculation (Manual J)

**What it is:** Engineering calculation to determine your home's exact heating and cooling needs.

**Inputs:**
- Home square footage and volume
- Insulation levels (walls, attic, basement)
- Window type, size, and orientation
- Air leakage (from blower door test if available)
- Local design temperature (-5°C to -25°C depending on BC region)
- Occupancy and internal heat gains

**Output:** Precise heating capacity needed (in BTU/hr or kW)

**Why it matters:**
- Oversized = short cycling, poor humidity control, wasted money
- Undersized = can't keep home warm on coldest days

**BC-specific:** Interior BC requires cold climate models sized for -15°C to -25°C design temperatures.
