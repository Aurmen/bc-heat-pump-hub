# Air-to-Water Heat Pumps in British Columbia

Air-to-water heat pumps extract heat from outdoor air and transfer it to water, which then circulates through your home's hydronic heating system. This technology is ideal for homes with radiators, in-floor radiant heating, or existing boiler infrastructure.

## How Air-to-Water Heat Pumps Work

Unlike air-to-air heat pumps (which blow warm air), air-to-water systems heat water to 35-65°C (95-149°F) for distribution through:
- Radiant floor heating
- Radiators or baseboard hydronic units
- Fan coil units
- Domestic hot water (some models)

**Key advantage:** They integrate seamlessly with existing hydronic systems, making them an excellent boiler replacement option.

## System Components

### Outdoor Unit
- Heat pump compressor and heat exchanger
- Extracts heat from outdoor air
- Operates efficiently down to -25°C (-13°F) or lower in cold-climate models

### Indoor Hydronic Module
- Buffer tank (often 50-200 liters)
- Circulation pumps
- Expansion tank
- Controls and zone valves

### Distribution System
- Existing radiators, baseboards, or in-floor loops
- Typically requires lower water temperatures than traditional boilers

## Efficiency & Performance

### COP (Coefficient of Performance)

Air-to-water heat pumps achieve:
- **COP 3.5-4.5** at 7°C (45°F) outdoor temp
- **COP 2.5-3.5** at -7°C (19°F) outdoor temp
- **COP 1.8-2.5** at -15°C (5°F) outdoor temp

This means for every 1 kWh of electricity consumed, you get 2.5-4.5 kWh of heat—far exceeding electric resistance heating (COP = 1.0) and surpassing high-efficiency gas boilers.

### Temperature Output

Most air-to-water systems can produce:
- **Low-temperature mode:** 35-45°C (95-113°F) for in-floor heating
- **Medium-temperature mode:** 45-55°C (113-131°F) for radiators
- **High-temperature mode:** 55-65°C (131-149°F) for older radiators or extreme cold (reduced efficiency)

## Climate Suitability in BC

### Coastal BC (Vancouver, Victoria, Lower Mainland)
**Excellent suitability.** Mild winters allow air-to-water heat pumps to operate at peak efficiency year-round. Ideal for homes with:
- In-floor radiant heating
- Low-temperature radiators
- Existing hydronic systems

### Vancouver Island
**Excellent suitability.** Similar to coastal BC. Many homeowners are replacing oil and propane boilers with air-to-water heat pumps for cost savings and reduced emissions.

### Interior BC (Kelowna, Kamloops)
**Good suitability with considerations.** Air-to-water heat pumps work well but may need:
- Cold-climate-rated models (-25°C / -13°F or lower)
- Backup electric or gas heating for extreme cold
- Properly sized buffer tanks to manage defrost cycles

### Northern Interior (Prince George)
**Requires hybrid configuration.** Combine air-to-water heat pump with gas or propane backup for temperatures below -20°C (-4°F).

## Installation Costs

**Air-to-water heat pump system installation in BC:**

| Home Size | System Capacity | Typical Cost Range |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1,000-1,500 sq ft | 6-9 kW (20,000-30,000 BTU/h) | $12,000-18,000 |
| 1,500-2,500 sq ft | 9-12 kW (30,000-41,000 BTU/h) | $15,000-22,000 |
| 2,500-3,500 sq ft | 12-16 kW (41,000-55,000 BTU/h) | $18,000-28,000 |

**Cost factors:**
- Existing hydronic infrastructure (lower cost if already present)
- Need for radiator upgrades (low-temp models may be needed)
- Electrical service upgrade (if required)
- Indoor buffer tank installation
- Domestic hot water integration (if desired)

## Integration with Existing Boiler Systems

### Retrofit Options

**Option 1: Full Replacement**
Remove existing boiler, install air-to-water heat pump as sole heat source.
- Best for coastal BC
- Requires cold-climate-rated unit in Interior BC
- May need radiator assessment (older radiators designed for 70-80°C / 158-176°F water may need replacement)

**Option 2: Hybrid System**
Keep existing boiler as backup, add air-to-water heat pump for primary heating.
- Heat pump operates down to -10 to -15°C (14-5°F)
- Boiler takes over during extreme cold or high-demand periods
- Maximizes efficiency while ensuring reliability

**Option 3: Domestic Hot Water Integration**
Some air-to-water models include domestic hot water (DHW) capability, replacing both heating and hot water systems.

## Operating Costs

**Example: 2,000 sq ft home in coastal BC**

| Heating System | Annual Energy Use | Annual Cost (@ $0.12/kWh, $1.50/GJ gas) |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Air-to-water heat pump (COP 3.5) | ~10,000 kWh | $1,200 |
| High-efficiency gas boiler (95% AFUE) | ~85 GJ | $1,275 |
| Electric boiler (100% efficient) | ~35,000 kWh | $4,200 |
| Propane boiler (90% AFUE) | ~4,000 L | $3,200-4,000 |

**Interior BC costs will be higher due to colder temperatures and longer heating season.**

## Rebates & Incentives
