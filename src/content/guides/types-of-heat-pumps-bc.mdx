# Types of Heat Pumps in BC: Complete Guide (2026)

Understanding the different types of heat pumps available in British Columbia helps you choose the right system for your home, climate zone, and heating needs. This guide covers all major heat pump types, their advantages, costs, and ideal applications.

## What is a Heat Pump?

A heat pump is an electric heating and cooling system that moves heat from one place to another, rather than generating heat through combustion or resistance. In winter, it extracts heat from outdoor air (even at sub-zero temperatures) and moves it indoors. In summer, it reverses the process, acting like an air conditioner.

**Key benefit:** Heat pumps are 200-400% efficient because they move heat instead of creating it. For every 1 kW of electricity consumed, they deliver 2-4 kW of heating.

## Air-Source Heat Pumps

Air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) extract heat from outdoor air. They're the most common type in BC residential applications.

### 1. Ductless Mini-Split Heat Pumps

**How it works:** One outdoor compressor connects to 1-8 indoor wall-mounted units via refrigerant lines.

**Components:**
- Outdoor condenser unit (contains compressor, heat exchanger, fan)
- Indoor wall units (quiet fan coils with filters)
- Refrigerant lines (copper pipes carrying refrigerant)
- Control wiring and condensate drain

**Advantages:**
- No ductwork required (ideal for older homes)
- Zone heating—control temperature room-by-room
- Quick installation (1-3 days for most homes)
- High efficiency (SEER 18-30, HSPF 9-13)
- Quiet operation (indoor units as low as 19 dB)

**Disadvantages:**
- Visible indoor wall units (aesthetics)
- Limited to rooms where units are installed
- Refrigerant line length limits (typically 50-150 ft)

**Best for:**
- Homes without ductwork
- Zone heating (bedrooms, living areas)
- Additions and renovations
- Supplementing existing heating

**Cost:** $8,500-$14,500 installed (BC Lower Mainland)
**After rebates:** $3,000-$9,000

**Popular in BC:** Vancouver, Victoria, Nanaimo, Kelowna—anywhere ductwork doesn't exist or isn't practical.

### 2. Ducted Central Heat Pumps

**How it works:** Single outdoor unit connects to indoor air handler (furnace-like unit) that distributes heated/cooled air through ductwork.

**Components:**
- Outdoor heat pump unit
- Indoor air handler (blower, coil, filter)
- Ductwork (existing or new)
- Thermostat (programmable or smart)
- Optional: backup electric heat strips

**Advantages:**
- Whole-home heating and cooling
- Hidden components (no visible indoor units)
- Even temperature distribution
- Integrates with existing forced-air systems
- Can add air filtration, humidification

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires ductwork ($3K-8K if none exists)
- No zone control (unless zoned ductwork added)
- Higher upfront cost if ductwork needed
- Less efficient than ductless in mild climates

**Best for:**
- Homes with existing ductwork
- New construction
- Whole-home comfort
- Replacing gas furnace + AC

**Cost:** $11,500-$17,500 installed
**After rebates:** $5,000-$12,000

**Popular in BC:** Langley, Abbotsford, Surrey—newer homes with ductwork, especially subdivisions built after 2000.

### 3. Cold Climate Heat Pumps

**Special category:** Enhanced air-source heat pumps designed for extreme cold.

**Key technologies:**
- Variable-speed inverter compressors
- Enhanced vapor injection (EVI)
- Larger heat exchangers
- Advanced defrost cycles
- Cold-weather refrigerants (R-32, R-410A optimized)

**Performance:**
- Rated to -20°C to -30°C (vs -15°C for standard)
- Maintain 100% capacity at -15°C
- COP ≥ 2.0 even at -20°C

**Cost premium:** +$1,500-$3,000 vs standard models

**Required in:** Interior BC (Kelowna, Kamloops, Vernon, Prince George) where design temps fall below -15°C.

**Brands:** Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat, Daikin Aurora, Fujitsu Halcyon XLTH, Carrier Greenspeed

## Air-to-Water Heat Pumps

Air-to-water heat pumps extract heat from outdoor air but deliver it via hot water instead of air. They're designed for homes with hydronic (water-based) heating systems.

**How it works:** Outdoor unit heats water to 35-65°C, which circulates through radiant floors, baseboard radiators, or panel radiators.

**Components:**
- Outdoor heat pump unit
- Indoor hydronic module (pump, controls, buffer tank)
- Heated water distribution (pipes, radiators, or in-floor tubing)
- Optional: DHW (domestic hot water) integration

**Advantages:**
- Works with existing radiant floor / baseboard systems
- Extremely comfortable (radiant heat feels warmer)
- Can provide domestic hot water
- Very quiet (no forced air noise)
- Long lifespan (20-25 years typical)

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher upfront cost ($14,500-$24,500)
- Slower response time (thermal mass)
- No cooling capability (heating only)
- More complex installation

**Best for:**
- Homes with radiant floors
- Replacing oil or propane boilers
- High-end renovations
- Multi-zone hydronic systems

**Cost:** $14,500-$24,500 installed
**After rebates:** $8,000-$19,000

**Popular in BC:** High-end homes on Vancouver Island, Whistler, Okanagan—anywhere hydronic heating is already installed.

**Brands:** Arctic Heat Pumps, Daikin Altherma, Mitsubishi Ecodan, Stiebel Eltron

## Ground-Source Heat Pumps (Geothermal)

Ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs), also called geothermal heat pumps, extract heat from the ground or a body of water instead of outdoor air.

**How it works:** Fluid circulates through underground pipes (ground loop), absorbing Earth's stable temperature (8-12°C year-round in BC). Heat pump concentrates this heat for space heating.

**Ground loop types:**
- **Horizontal:** Pipes buried 1.5-2m deep in trenches (requires large yard)
- **Vertical:** Boreholes drilled 50-150m deep (small footprint)
- **Pond/lake:** Pipes submerged in water body (if available)

**Advantages:**
- Highest efficiency (COP 3.5-5.0 year-round)
- No outdoor unit (quiet, no defrost cycles)
- Works in any climate (ground temp stable)
- Long lifespan (ground loop: 50+ years)
- Provides cooling in summer

**Disadvantages:**
- Very high upfront cost ($25,000-$40,000+)
- Requires land for ground loop
- Disruptive installation (excavation/drilling)
- Long payback period (15-25 years)

**Best for:**
- New construction with land
- Rural properties
- Off-grid homes
- Long-term investment (staying 20+ years)

**Cost:** $25,000-$40,000+ installed
**After rebates:** $20,000-$35,000 (limited rebates for geothermal)

**Rare in BC:** High cost and long payback make air-source heat pumps more attractive. Mostly used in off-grid, rural, or very cold climates where air-source struggles.

## Hybrid / Dual Fuel Systems

**What it is:** Heat pump paired with backup heating system (usually gas boiler or furnace).

**How it works:** Heat pump handles heating most of the time (efficient, low cost). When outdoor temps drop below a setpoint (-10°C to -15°C), backup system takes over.

**Advantages:**
- Best of both worlds (efficiency + reliability)
- Lower operating costs than gas-only
- No worry about extreme cold performance
- Keeps existing boiler (lower upfront cost)

**Disadvantages:**
- Two systems to maintain
- Requires controls integration
- Still dependent on natural gas

**Best for:**
- Interior BC (cold winters)
- Risk-averse homeowners
- Homes with existing gas boiler
- Large homes with high heating loads

**Cost:** $2,500-$5,000 additional for integration (if boiler already exists)

## Absorption Heat Pumps (Rare in Residential)

**How it works:** Uses heat source (natural gas, propane, waste heat) instead of electricity to drive the refrigeration cycle.

**Why rare:** Complex, expensive, mostly commercial applications. Not common in BC residential market.

---

## Window / Portable Heat Pumps

**What it is:** Small, self-contained units installed in windows or as portable units.

**Capacity:** 5,000-12,000 BTU (enough for single room)

**Cost:** $500-$1,500

**Use case:** Temporary heating/cooling, rental units, single-room supplement. **Not recommended** as primary heating in BC (poor efficiency, limited capacity).
