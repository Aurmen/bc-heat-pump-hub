# 2026 BC Heat Pump Rebate Estimator

British Columbia offers among the most generous heat pump incentive stacks in Canada. In 2026, an oil-heated homeowner can access up to **$16,000 in grants** by combining federal and provincial programs — before touching the Canada Greener Homes Loan.

The calculator below estimates the grants you may be eligible for based on your heating source and property type.

## How BC Rebates Stack in 2026

BC homeowners can layer multiple programs — but the order of application matters. Purchasing equipment before certain pre-approvals are in place can disqualify you from specific programs.

| Program | Who Qualifies | Maximum Grant |
|---|---|---|
| Oil to Heat Pump Affordability (OHPA) | Oil or propane-heated homes | $10,000 |
| CleanBC Better Homes | Most BC homeowners | $6,000 (ducted) / $2,000 (ductless) |
| CleanBC Income-Qualified Top-Up | Households under ~$84,000 net | +$2,000 |
| BC Hydro Rebate | BC Hydro service area | $2,000 (ducted) / $1,000 (ductless) |
| BC Hydro Condo Program | Strata/condo units | $2,250 standard / $5,000 income-qualified |

The **Canada Greener Homes Loan** ($40,000 interest-free, up to 10 years) is available to most homeowners and stacks on top of grants — but it is a loan that must be repaid, not a grant.

    Do not purchase or install equipment before your pre-approval is in place for income-qualified programs. For OHPA, you must apply and receive confirmation <strong>before</strong> signing an installation contract. Read the full step-by-step guide before proceeding.

## Rebate Eligibility Checklist

Before applying, confirm your contractor can provide:

- **CleanBC registered contractor ID** (required for Better Homes rebates)
- **AHRI matched system certificate** (equipment must appear on the CleanBC eligible product list)

A contractor who cannot provide these documents cannot process your rebate application.
