# Boiler Replacement Costs in BC (2024-2026)

Replacing a boiler in British Columbia involves equipment, labor, permits, and potential system upgrades. This guide provides realistic cost ranges and explains factors affecting boiler replacement pricing.

## Cost Ranges by Boiler Type

### Natural Gas Boilers

**Standard efficiency (80-85% AFUE):**

- Suitable for: Older homes, budget-conscious replacements

**High-efficiency condensing (90-98% AFUE):**
- Equipment + installation: $6,000-12,000
- Best for: New installations, long-term savings
- Rebate-eligible in some programs

**Combi boilers (heating + domestic hot water):**
- Equipment + installation: $7,000-14,000

### Propane Boilers

**Standard efficiency:**
- Equipment + installation: $5,000-9,000

**High-efficiency:**
- Equipment + installation: $7,000-13,000

**Note:** Propane boilers cost ~10-20% more than natural gas equivalents due to different burner requirements.

### Electric Boilers

**Standard electric boiler:**
- Equipment + installation: $3,000-8,000
- Lower upfront cost
- **Much higher operating costs** (~3-4x natural gas)

**Best for:**
- Homes without gas service
- Very small spaces (under 1,000 sq ft)
- Locations where electricity is cheaper or heat pump isn't viable

### Oil-to-Gas Conversions

**Complete conversion:**
- Remove oil tank: $1,500-3,000
- Install gas line (if needed): $2,000-8,000
- New gas boiler: $6,000-12,000
- **Total:** $10,000-20,000+

**Environmental remediation (if oil tank leaked):** +$5,000-30,000

## Cost Breakdown by Home Size

| Home Size | Boiler Capacity | Gas Boiler Cost | Propane Boiler Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1,000-1,500 sq ft | 50,000-80,000 BTU/h (15-23 kW) | $6,000-10,000 | $7,000-11,000 |
| 1,500-2,500 sq ft | 80,000-120,000 BTU/h (23-35 kW) | $7,000-11,000 | $8,000-12,000 |

**Power venting:**
- Required if no chimney available
- Additional cost: +$1,000-2,500

### 3. Hydronic System Modifications

**Simple replacement (no changes):**
- Boiler connects to existing piping
- Lower cost

**System upgrades needed:**
- Zone valves: +$300-800 per zone
- New circulation pumps: +$400-1,200
- Piping modifications: +$500-3,000

**Combi boiler (replaces boiler + hot water tank):**
- Higher equipment cost: +$1,000-3,000
- Saves space
- May reduce total system cost by eliminating separate tank

**Indirect water heater (uses boiler to heat water):**
- Tank cost: +$1,500-3,500
- Piping and controls: +$500-1,500

## Operating Cost Comparison

**Example: 2,000 sq ft home in BC Interior**

| Boiler Type | Efficiency | Annual Energy Use | Annual Cost |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Gas (high-efficiency, 95% AFUE) | 95% | 85 GJ | $1,275 |
| Gas (standard, 80% AFUE) | 80% | 101 GJ | $1,515 |
| Propane (high-efficiency, 92% AFUE) | 92% | ~3,800 L | $3,040-3,800 |
| Electric boiler | 100% | 35,000 kWh | $4,200 |
| **Heat pump (for comparison)** | COP 3.0 | 12,000 kWh | $1,440 |

**Assumptions:** Natural gas at $1.50/GJ, propane at $0.80-1.00/L, electricity at $0.12/kWh.

## When to Replace vs. Repair

### Replace If:
- Boiler is 15+ years old
- Efficiency is below 80% AFUE
- Frequent repairs (more than 2-3 per year)
- Cracks in heat exchanger
- Rising energy bills
- Switching fuel types

### Repair If:
- Boiler is under 10 years old
- Single component failure (pump, valve, thermostat)
- Repair cost is less than 30% of replacement cost
- System is still efficient

## Boiler vs. Heat Pump Decision

**Consider a heat pump instead if:**
- You're replacing electric resistance or oil heating
- You live in coastal BC (mild winters)
- You want cooling in summer
- Rebates make heat pumps cost-competitive
- You prioritize lower operating costs

**Stick with boiler replacement if:**
- You have a well-functioning hydronic system
- Natural gas is very cheap in your area
- You need very high heat output (large, poorly insulated home)
- You live in extreme cold climates and want proven reliability

**Consider hybrid (heat pump + boiler) if:**
- You live in BC Interior
- You want efficiency + reliability
- You qualify for heat pump rebates

## Conclusion

Boiler replacement in BC ranges from $6,000-14,000 for most residential installations. High-efficiency models qualify for rebates up to $2,000, making them more cost-effective long-term despite higher upfront costs.

Before replacing a boiler, consider whether a heat pump or hybrid system might be more suitable for your home and climate. For many BC homeowners—especially in coastal regions—heat pumps offer lower operating costs and qualify for much higher rebates ($11,000+).

Always get multiple quotes, verify installer credentials, and confirm rebate eligibility before proceeding.
